2. And then, run the server.py file in terminal
	>python server.py
3. After that, open another command prompt (different with first terminal you've opened) to open the client.py socket
	>python client.py
4. And then, you can input the IP Address of the server to the client terminal
5. Then, input the operator and two operand in client terminal
6. And finally, you get the result of your operation because your client socket is connected with server socket well.
